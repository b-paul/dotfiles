# Dotfiles!

Dotfiles are managed with stow

To install one module do

```
stow [module name]
```
if this repository is in your home folder (`~/dotfiles` or something), else do

```
stow -t ~/
```

These dotfiles assume you use `~/.config` for your config mostly and not something else set with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.
