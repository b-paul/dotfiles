# Dotfiles!

Dotfiles managed with stow

To install a module do

```
./stow.sh [module name]
```
if this repository is in your home folder (`~/dotfiles` or something), else do

```
./stow.sh -t ~/
```

These dotfiles assume you use `~/.config` for your config instead of something else set with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` though this might change one day.

Ideally every bit of software that I have tried would have a configuration here, but that isn't done yet.

Software to try:

Sway
River
Kiwmi
Openbox
xmonad

like anything wayland at all
sway
ratpoison
sdorfehs
cwm
twm
