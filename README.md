# Dotfiles!

Dotfiles managed with stow

To install a module do

```
stow [module name]
```
if this repository is in your home folder (`~/dotfiles` or something), else do

```
stow -t ~/
```

These dotfiles assume you use `~/.config` for your config instead of something else set with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` though this might change one day.

Ideally every bit of software that I have tried would have a configuration here, but that isn't done yet.

Software to try:

Awesome
Sway
River
Openbox

Kitty
Wezterm

Fish

Rofi
